# STEP 0: SETUP

## 1. Install python dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 2. Set up env

Copy `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` and replace the placeholders.

## 3. Test the application

Try running `py assistant.py`.

Look around in `assistant` and `components/assistance.py`

The structure of this project is based on creating an "Assistance" and loading it with callbacks that can be called by the main assistant script. This is to give more freedom for the individual parsers to decide how the assistant acts.

## 4. Add an action

Add another, simple action to the assitant to test the functionality.

## Go to next step

Checkout branch `1-openai`.
