## Build your own assistant using LLMs

<!-- classes: talk -->

## What can you use LLMs for?
<!-- fragments-start -->

<!-- note If you're a student with 5 minutes to your deadline -->
- ✍️ Cheating on your homework

```ascii
    _______________________________________________________________________
   / A toilet is a piece of sanitary hardware that collects human urine... \
🤖/\_______________________________________________________________________/
```

<!-- note Maybe you are a megacorporation hell bent on saving money wherever you can -->
- 🤖 Fully automating writing articles and handling customer relations

```ascii
    ______________________________________________________________________________
   / Taylor Swift was seen today eating a hot dog. Hot dog stock price surges ... \
🤖/\______________________________________________________________________________/
```

<!-- note A shady amazon retailer who wants it to look like people like your product -->
- 👍 Automate comments that say good things

```ascii
    _________________________________________________________
   / I am really happy with the purchase of my Bored Ape NFT \
🤖/\________________________________________________________/
```

But what if we want to make it do more than just give us text that we copy-paste somewhere?

# It's alive!!!
<!-- fragments-start -->
It almost seems like it is has intelligence and can make decisions

```ascii
    _______________________________________________________________
   / My favorite song is William Shatner's rendition of Rocket man \
🤖/\_______________________________________________________________/
```

But can we make it act on those "decisions"?

```ascii
> 🤖 Play Rocket Man cover by William Shatner in Rocket man 
```

That's what we want to do today.
